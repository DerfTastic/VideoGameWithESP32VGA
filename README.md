# DerfTastic's Additions (so far)

- Got the project to work on my ESP-WROOM-32S development board with the [PlatfromIO](https://platformio.org/) extension for VSCode.
- Got one of my own models of a table in the `gfx/` folder to work

This was my first time actually using an ESP32 so I was really surprise at how fast it actually is. I'll probably be using this more than my arduino for quick microcontroller things now.

### Future plans:

- Allow button input to be taken in so that a game can actually be made
- Make an interface to draw 2D sprites
